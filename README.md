# SIOP2020ML

An employee candidate selection algorithm was developed aimed at reducing turnover and increasing performance for Walmart. This was an entry for the 2020 SIOP machine learning competition.

Datasets contain results from employee assessments administered prior to hiring. 

In cleaning the data, candidate profiles with more than 25% missing values were omitted. Any remaining missing values were imputed using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. 

Algorithms were trained and analysis performed in Python using the scikit-learn library.
